      <p>
        🏢 I work for myself, and I also support

        🛠️ I am an amateur front-end developer & maintainer.
        <i>BTW, I am learning how to make a back-end project now.</i>
      </p>

        🎮 I am also a gamer. My favorite games are Minecraft, Arcaea and
        Phigros.

      <h2>About my work</h2>
      <p>👀 I have a personal lab called Sliver Complex.</p>
      <p>
        😶 I usually focus on developing front-end projects using front-end
        frameworks like React, Vue, Svelte, etc. or maintaining them.
      </p>
      <p>
        🧐 I use Nitro (<a href="https://nitro.unjs.io" target="_blank"
          >nitro.unjs.io</a
        >) as my backend framework for learning and related development.
      </p>
      <p>
        🥳 I am glad to help my friends build their websites or even make a
        special template if I can! The source will be open-source at my personal
        lab.
