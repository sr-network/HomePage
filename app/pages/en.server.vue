		<h2>Who am I?</h2>
		<p>
			I am a senior high school student who comes from Guangxi, and I am also an unqualified
			front-end developer on the Internet.
		</p>
		<p>
			My English name is Restent Ou, as well as my other common name SliverRiver and game ID
			undefinedR2.<s
				>The "Sliver" in "SliverRiver" was intentionally mistype, don't ask me why not "Silver" (run
				away).</s
			>
		</p>
		<p>
			I am a member of
			<a href="https://www.travellings.cn" target="_blank">Travellings</a>
			maintenance team &
			<a href="https://speed.14cloud.cn" target="_blank">14Cloud</a>
			management team. BTW, most of my time was spent in my lab,
			<a href="https://github.com/s-complex" target="_blank">"Sliver Complex"</a>.
		</p>
		<h2>My skills</h2>
		<p>
			Building front-end projects is probably the only skill I have fully mastered. Now I have good
			knowledge about writing
			<a href="https://cn.vuejs.org" target="_blank">Vue.js</a> and
			<a href="https://svelte.dev" target="_blank">Svelte</a>
			. But as far as the heart is concerned, I am still not entirely proficient in them, so I am
			trying to learn.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am also trying to write a back-end project, but at this stage, I will only be targeting
			back-end frameworks based on Node.js. My
			<a href="https://github.com/s-complex/api" target="_blank">website API</a> is written in
			<a href="https://nitrojs.dev" target="_blank">Nitro.js</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			For other skills that I know a little about, if they're not in high demand in my visual
			future, I probably won't focus my learning on them.
		</p>
		<h2>My favorite</h2>
		<p>
			I'm now passionate about Minecraft and rhythm games like Arcaea, Phigros, Rotaeno and maimai
			DX.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm also interested in a variety of electronic devices, though personal computers and their
			associated equipment are still the main focus at this time.
