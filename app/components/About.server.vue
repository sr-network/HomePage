		<h2>Who am I?</h2>
		<p>
			I am active on the web as "Restent Ou" or "SliverRiver", and I have a
			game ID "undefinedR2". You can mostly call me "Restent", "Res", "Sli" or
			"R2".
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm now studying at a senior high school in Guangxi, and I'm now preparing
			for the National Higher Education Entrance Examination next year.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the same time, I'm also a member of the <a href="https://www.travellings.cn" target="_blank">Travellings</a> maintenance team and
			am currently responsible for most of the team's new site review tasks.
		</p>
		<h2>My skills</h2>
		<p>
			I'm a developer who is passionate about open source, but with no
			masterpiece.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm more of a front-end developer, proficient in Vue, but also familiar
			with React and Svelte development. At the same time, I'm learning back-end
			development, currently with
			<a href="https://nitro.unjs.io" target="_blank">Nitro</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			I've also learned skills other than front-end and back-end, but obviously
			- I'm not good at them.
		</p>
		<h2>My favorite</h2>
		<p>
			I'm a fan of rhythm games and Minecraft. If I had to describe how much I
			love them, then most of my free time is devoted to them.
		</p>
        <p>I am also interested in IT, electronics and public transportation.</p>
